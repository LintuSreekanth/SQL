# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from BreakInToTech.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# List the track_name, popularity and duration of tracks that is by artist â€œ'Olivia Rodrigo'
1.	Select id, track_name,popularity, duration_ms
             FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Olivia Rodrigo'


# Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity

2.	Select id, artist_name,track_name, danceability, popularity
            from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
            WHERE popularity >=90
            AND time_signature=4
              ORDER BY popularity desc
#Then I determined which track has duration less than 200000
3.	Select id, artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
             from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
             where duration_ms< 200000


#Then I counted   the total track that has duration less than 200000
4.	Select count(id)
            from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where duration_ms< 200000
